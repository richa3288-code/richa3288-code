Hi, I’m Richa 👋  

I work as an automation tester and use this GitHub to track my learning and hands-on practice.  

**Professional focus:** Selenium automation with Python, SAP Tosca, and maintaining regression suites in Agile projects.  

You’ll find small automation projects, practice scripts, and testing notes here.  

I’m continuously improving my skills in Git, GitHub, and CI basics.  

Thanks for visiting 🙂
